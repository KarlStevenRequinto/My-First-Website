                <p>I learned html and css about over a month ago and for me, it is very rewarding. This is the first project that I ever created. Feel free to explore my online resume.</p>
                <p>I am an Electronics Engineer(which I don't practice anymore to make a living). I trade Gold everyday and make money out of it, I love playing DoTA, and my new passion is coding.</p>
                <p>I have a burning desire in learning new things, acquiring knowledge, and solving problems. I plan to be the Adolf Hitler of programming. Make no sense but I don't care.</p>
